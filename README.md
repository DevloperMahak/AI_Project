## 📌 Problem Statement
 
Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI magic with Groq


---

## 🎯 Objective


 **🧠Problem:** Students often struggle to get instant, accurate help with academic doubts—especially in subjects like Math, Science, and Programming—due to limited access to personal tutors, language barriers, and lack of interactive tools that support voice, image, and text inputs.


 **💡Solution:** 
I’m building a real-time AI-powered tutoring app where students can:

✅ Solve doubts using AI through voice, image, and text input

✅ Collaborate and discuss with others in a shared space

✅ Get instant help with subject-specific prompts powered by GROQ’s advanced LLM

✅ Experience an intuitive and responsive interface designed for students

This solution bridges the gap between traditional tutoring and modern, interactive, AI-based learning.


 **🛠 Real-World Use Case:** 
- A student give a text/voice/image input of a doubt problem → gets the solution response instantly through AI powered by GROQ .

- A user types or speaks a programming error → gets AI guidance and can discuss it with peers.

- Late-night study sessions become productive without needing a human tutor online.


**Value It Provides:** 
👩‍🎓 For Students:
- **Instant Help, Anytime:** – No more waiting for a tutor or posting on forums. Get instant answers using voice, image, or text.

- **Multimodal Doubt Solving:** – Students can speak, type, or upload an image of a problem. Perfect for math and complex diagrams.

- **Collaborative Learning:** – Discuss and learn with peers in real-time, turning doubt solving into a social experience.

- **Personalized Tutoring:** – The app tailors answers based on selected subjects like Math, Science, or Programming.

- **Stress-Free Experience:** – Reduces academic anxiety by providing a judgment-free, always-available tutor.

**🏷️"Don’t just ask — collaborate, solve, and master with AskMyTutor."**

### Your Approach:  

### 🔍 Why We Chose This Problem
We noticed and also realised ourselves as a student that students often get stuck on difficult questions and struggle to find instant help—especially in subjects like math or science. Many existing platforms are either too slow, too complex, or lack interactivity. We wanted to create a solution that offers instant, intelligent doubt-solving through AI and also provides a space for real-time collaboration with fellow learners.

AskMyTutor was born to make learning faster, smarter, and more connected.  

 ### 🧩 Key Challenges We Addressed
- 🧠 Real-time Doubt Solving: Integrating an LLM (GROQ) to instantly answer user questions via text or voice.

- 🎙️ Speech-to-Text & Image OCR: Supporting multiple input modes for ease of use—students can ask via text, voice, or even by uploading handwritten question images.

- 💬 Collaborative Chat Feature: Enabling peer-to-peer discussion within the app so students can learn from one another.

- ⚡ Fast & Accurate AI Responses: Ensuring our GROQ integration responds with speed and reliability.

- 🎨 Simple & Student-Friendly UI: Designed to be intuitive and visually friendly for students of all levels.

### 🚀 Pivots, Brainstorms & Breakthroughs 
- Initially, the focus was just on voice/image AI doubt-solving. But during hacking, we realized the real value lies in collaboration, so we pivoted to include group chat/discussion rooms.

- Implementing GROQ provided a breakthrough in response speed and cost-effectiveness.

- We also brainstormed a new way of handling OCR preprocessing using sharp (grayscale + thresholding + normalize + sharpen) for clearer text recognition before passing to Tesseract.js.

## 🏁 Final Words

Participating in HACKHAZARDS '25 was an incredible journey of learning, building, and pushing limits. From brainstorming ideas late into the night to debugging that one persistent error moments before submission—we experienced it all.

We faced challenges like integrating real-time voice and image input with AI, ensuring seamless backend communication, and designing a user-friendly UI. But with every bug we crushed and every breakthrough we celebrated, we grew more confident in our solution.

We’re proud of how AskMyTutor evolved—from an idea to a fully working AI-powered collaborative tutor. This project wasn’t just about code—it was about reimagining how students can learn together, faster and smarter.

Big shout-out to our mentors, the organizing team, and everyone who helped test, review, and encourage us along the way. 💜

We’re excited to take this beyond the hackathon and continue building a tool that empowers learners everywhere. 🚀
